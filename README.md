# Toxic_Comments
Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.  The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both a part of Alphabet) are working on tools to help improve online conversation. One area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). So far they’ve built a range of publicly available models served through the Perspective API, including toxicity. But the current models still make errors, and they don’t allow users to select which types of toxicity they’re interested in finding (e.g. some platforms may be fine with profanity, but not with other types of toxic content).

## Refer to the following notebooks for further understanding:

<br/>
I want to use Keras as I found out that this will provide a better efficiency to finding out the TFIDF value and operation. 
<br/>
<br/>
But other than Keras, which would be something I want to use later on in the project, I wanted to start by finding the normal TFIDF calculation, and then using a Descsion Tree or any other suitable model through 5-fold.
